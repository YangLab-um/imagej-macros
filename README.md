# ImageJ Macros
Repository of ImageJ scripts used in image processing by the Yang Lab at the University of Michigan

# Current scripts
- `Make_FRET_Ratio_video.ijm`: Creates AVI videos of the FRET Ratio signal for single or multiple microscope positions. FRET and CFP channels needed.

# Installation
The scripts can be run using two methods:
1. Open the script as a file in ImageJ's editor and click 'Run'
2. Copy the contents of `script` into ImageJ's `script` folder (found in ImageJ's installation directory). This method incorporates the scripts into ImageJ's `Plugins/Scripts` menu.
